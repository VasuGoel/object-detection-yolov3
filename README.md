# Object Detection using YOLOv3
Deep Learning Object Detection in image, video and stream data using YOLOv3 object detection algorithm with OpenCV real-time 
computer vision library. YOLOv3 is the latest variant of the popular object detection algorithm YOLO - You Only Look Once. The
published model recognizes 80 different objects of the COCO dataset in images and videos.
